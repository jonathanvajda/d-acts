# The Document Acts Ontology
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/d-acts
The Document Acts Ontology (D-Acts) represents the domain of entities related to acts that change social reality by means of various information instruments, especially a document. Document acts are an analogue to speech acts, and so much of speech act theory developed by J. L. Austin, John Searle, and others are relevant mutatis mutandis to a formal document act theory. The ontology is based on a theory of document acts proposed by Barry Smith and Adolph Reinach’s theory of social acts and legal entities. However, there are some amendments from our side which are to be found in the D-Acts documentation.
